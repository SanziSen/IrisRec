# IrisRec
Using sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train our model using logistic regression. We need to figure out accuracy of our model and use that to predict different samples in your test dataset. In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,  Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width Using above 4 features you will classify a flower in one of the 3 categories:-  Setosa,  Versicolour, Virginica

The provided machine learning model uses the principles of Multiclass Logistic Regression where the model is trained using the previously captured data and then used to predict the type of flower using the model on the data provided by the Iris dataset.
